Welcome to Cobblemon Trials Edition!

Regardless, I sincerely appreciate that you would check out my mod.

Cobblemon Trials Edition
=======

Cobblemon Trials Edition is a mod for Cobblemon that adds a new highly configurable block to replace newly generated Mob Spawners or Trial Spawners in your Structures or World. This mod replaces a list of Default Structures and Spawners (Listed below) and can be configued with a Datapack replace Spawners in Structures from other Mods (See Wiki for more info).

Cobblemon Trial Spawners function almost exactly like regular Trial Spawners so players and modpack makers do not have to learn any new mechanics. In addition a new Potion is also added. The "Trial Potion" which after brewing Awkward Potions and Sculk will give you a potion that applys the Trial Omen Effect. Giving an alternative way to activate the Ominous Mode of Cobblemon Trial Spawners.
